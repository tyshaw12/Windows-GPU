# Windows-GPU

# Overview

This is a 'program' that allows a GPU to be utilized in Tensorflow in Windows.

The reason I developed this was so that I could get machine learning models running on my PC as it is fairly powerful and I wanted the best models possible.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

Google Colab for the machine learning models

Jupyter Notebooks for running Python

Nvidia Cuda Nsight, Runtime, Development,  and SDK to run the NVIDIA 3070 ti GPU

Other stuff I'm sure I am forgetting. This was a nightmare to get running.

I used Python for the most part but there was some editing I had to do with Windows settings that didn't use a language.

All of the libraries were specific to the machine learning models and not really a part of this project but they'll be included here anyways.

Libraries: tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, sklearn

# Useful Websites

Unfortunately there was literally no useful information online and I had to piece it all together myself from various awful documentations.

# Future Work

* Create Inclusive tutorial showing exactly how I got it to work so others won't suffer like I did.
* Get it so that if a machine learning model is a certain size it runs on CPU, any bigger then it runs on GPU.
